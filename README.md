## 1. **Program Description**

You work at a company that specializes in student loan refinancing. If the company can predict whether a borrower will repay their loan, it can provide a more accurate interest rate for the borrower. Your team has asked you to create a model to predict student loan repayment.

The business team has given you a CSV file that contains information about previous student loan recipients. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a model that will predict the likelihood that an applicant will repay their student loans. The CSV file contains information about these students, such as their credit ranking.

## 3. **Prerequisites**
```bash
pip install pandas tensorflow sklearn keras pathlib
```
If unable to install tensorflow or keras on your local machine due to requirements for processor, you will need to run this file from Google Colab. 


## 4. **How to run the notebook**


Within VS Code, select the **"student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb"** file and execute each of the code cells within the notebook from top to bottom in order.

Within Google Colab, open the file **"student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb"** and execute each of the code cells within the notebook from top to bottom in order.


## 5. **README.md**

This file. 


## 6. **student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb**

This notebook contains the various code cells that will cover the following:

1. Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.
2. Compile and evaluate a model using a neural network.
3. Predict loan repayment success by using your neural network model.
4. Discuss creating a recommendation system for student loans.
